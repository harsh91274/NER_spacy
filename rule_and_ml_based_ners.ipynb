      "[\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\", '\\nCHAPTER ONE', 'THE BOY WHO LIVED', \"Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say\\nthat they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last\\npeople you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,\\nbecause they just didn't hold with such nonsense.\", 'Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\\ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did\\nhave a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\\nnearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she\\nspent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the\\nneighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their\\nopinion there was no finer boy anywhere.', \"The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't\\nthink they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.\\nPotter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;\\nin fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her\\nsister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was\\npossible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the\\nPotters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy\\nwas another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want\\nDudley mixing with a child like that.\", 'When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that\\nstrange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the\\ncountry. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for\\nwork, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming\\nDudley into his high chair.', 'None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.', 'At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\\nDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,\\nbecause Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the\\nwalls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got\\ninto his car and backed out of number four\\'s drive.', \"It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\\nsomething peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley\\ndidn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to\\nlook again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet\\nDrive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking\\nof? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and\\nstared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the\\ncorner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now\\nreading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats\\ncouldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and\\nput the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of\\nnothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\", \"But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\\nelse. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help\\nnoticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\\nabout. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in\\nfunny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this\\nwas some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering\\nwheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite\\nclose by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was\\nenraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man\\nhad to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\\nnerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some\\nsilly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...\\nyes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.\\nDursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\", \"Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\\nninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate\\non drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad\\ndaylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed\\nopen- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never\\nseen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly\\nnormal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made\\nseveral important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a\\nvery good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs\\nand walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\", \"He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\\nthem next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't\\nknow why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering\\nexcitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on\\nhis way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he\\ncaught a few words of what they were saying.\", '\"The Potters, that\\'s right, that\\'s what I heard yes, their son, Harry\"', 'Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\\nwhisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better\\nof it.', \"He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\\nsecretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost\\nfinished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the\\nreceiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was\\nbeing stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were\\nlots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think\\nof it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even\\nseen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point\\nin worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her\\nsister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all\\nthe same, those people in cloaks...\", \"He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and\\nwhen he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that\\nhe walked straight into someone just outside the door.\", '\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It\\nwas a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a\\nviolet cloak. He didn\\'t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the\\nground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in\\na squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don\\'t be sorry, my dear sir,\\nfor nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at\\nlast! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy,\\nhappy day!\"', 'And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.', \"Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\\nstranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that\\nwas. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping\\nhe was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he\\ndidn't approve of imagination.\", \"As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw --\\nand it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that\\nmorning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the\\nsame one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\", '\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn\\'t move. It just gave him a\\nstern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying\\nto pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still\\ndetermined not to mention anything to his wife.', 'Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\\nabout Mrs. Next Door\\'s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\\nlearned a new word (\"Won\\'t!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When\\nDudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to\\ncatch the last report on the evening news:', '\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\\'s\\nowls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally\\nhunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been\\nhundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since\\nsunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly\\nchanged their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin.\\n\"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going\\nto be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\"', '\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don\\'t know about that, but it\\'s not\\nonly the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as\\nKent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead\\nof the rain I promised yesterday, they\\'ve had a downpour of shooting\\nstars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it\\'s\\nnot until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\"', 'Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?\\nOwls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?\\nAnd a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...', 'Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was\\nno good. He\\'d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat\\nnervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven\\'t heard from your sister\\nlately, have you?\"', \"As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,\\nthey normally pretended she didn't have a sister.\", '\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"', '\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls... shooting\\nstars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...\"', '\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.', '\"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you\\nknow... her crowd.\"', 'Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered\\nwhether he dared tell her he\\'d heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he\\ndidn\\'t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son --\\nhe\\'d be about Dudley\\'s age now, wouldn\\'t he?\"', '\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.', '\"What\\'s his name again? Howard, isn\\'t it?\"', '\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"', '\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite\\nagree.\"', \"He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\\nWhile Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom\\nwindow and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there.\\nIt was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for\\nsomething.\", \"Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the\\nPotters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of\\n-- well, he didn't think he could bear it.\", \"The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\\nDursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting\\nthought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were\\ninvolved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.\\nDursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about\\nthem and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get\\nmixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over\\n-- it couldn't affect them....\", 'How very wrong he was.', \"Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat\\non the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as\\nstill as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of\\nPrivet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the\\nnext street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly\\nmidnight before the cat moved at all.\", \"A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\\nsuddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the\\nground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\", \"Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\\nthin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which\\nwere both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes,\\na purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.\\nHis blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon\\nspectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been\\nbroken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.\", 'Albus Dumbledore didn\\'t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\\nstreet where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was\\nbusy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to\\nrealize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat,\\nwhich was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For\\nsome reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and\\nmuttered, \"I should have known.\"', \"He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\\nsilver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and\\nclicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He\\nclicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times\\nhe clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street\\nwere two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat\\nwatching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed\\nMrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening\\ndown on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his\\ncloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down\\non the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he\\nspoke to it.\", '\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"', 'He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling\\nat a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly\\nthe shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was\\nwearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight\\nbun. She looked distinctly ruffled.', '\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.', '\"My dear Professor, I \\'ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"', '\"You\\'d be stiff if you\\'d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said\\nProfessor McGonagall.', '\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a\\ndozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"', 'Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.', '\"Oh yes, everyone\\'s celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently.\\n\"You\\'d think they\\'d be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles\\nhave noticed something\\'s going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her\\nhead back at the Dursleys\\' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks\\nof owls... shooting stars.... Well, they\\'re not completely stupid. They\\nwere bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I\\'ll bet\\nthat was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\"', '\"You can\\'t blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We\\'ve had precious\\nlittle to celebrate for eleven years.\"', '\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that\\'s no\\nreason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on\\nthe streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,\\nswapping rumors.\"', 'She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping\\nhe was going to tell her something, but he didn\\'t, so she went on. \"A\\nfine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have\\ndisappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he\\nreally has gone, Dumbledore?\"', '\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful\\nfor. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"', '\"A what?\"', '\"A lemon drop. They\\'re a kind of Muggle sweet I\\'m rather fond of\"', '\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\\'t\\nthink this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if\\nYou-Know-Who has gone -\"', '\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him\\nby his name? All this \\'You- Know-Who\\' nonsense -- for eleven years I\\nhave been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:\\nVoldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was\\nunsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so\\nconfusing if we keep saying \\'You-Know-Who.\\' I have never seen any reason\\nto be frightened of saying Voldemort\\'s name.', '\"I know you haven \\'t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half\\nexasperated, half admiring. \"But you\\'re different. Everyone knows you\\'re\\nthe only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\"', '\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will\\nnever have.\"', '\"Only because you\\'re too -- well -- noble to use them.\"', '\"It\\'s lucky it\\'s dark. I haven\\'t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\\ntold me she liked my new earmuffs.\"', 'Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \"The owls\\nare nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what\\neveryone\\'s saying? About why he\\'s disappeared? About what finally\\nstopped him?\"', 'It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most\\nanxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard\\nwall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed\\nDumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that\\nwhatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until\\nDumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing\\nanother lemon drop and did not answer.', '\"What they\\'re saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort\\nturned up in Godric\\'s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is\\nthat Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they\\'re -- dead. \"', 'Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.', '\"Lily and James... I can\\'t believe it... I didn\\'t want to believe it...\\nOh, Albus...\"', 'Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know... I\\nknow...\" he said heavily.', 'Professor McGonagall\\'s voice trembled as she went on. \"That\\'s not all.\\nThey\\'re saying he tried to kill the Potter\\'s son, Harry. But -- he\\ncouldn\\'t. He couldn\\'t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how,\\nbut they\\'re saying that when he couldn\\'t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\\'s\\npower somehow broke -- and that\\'s why he\\'s gone.', 'Dumbledore nodded glumly.', '\"It\\'s -- it\\'s true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he\\'s\\ndone... all the people he\\'s killed... he couldn\\'t kill a little boy?\\nIt\\'s just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the\\nname of heaven did Harry survive?\"', '\"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"', 'Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her\\neyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a\\ngolden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch.\\nIt had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving\\naround the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because\\nhe put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid\\'s late. I suppose it was\\nhe who told you I\\'d be here, by the way?\"', '\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don\\'t suppose you\\'re going to\\ntell me why you\\'re here, of all places?\"', '\"I\\'ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\\'re the only family\\nhe has left now.\"', '\"You don\\'t mean -- you can\\'t mean the people who live here?\" cried\\nProfessor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.\\n\"Dumbledore -- you can\\'t. I\\'ve been watching them all day. You couldn\\'t\\nfind two people who are less like us. And they\\'ve got this son -- I saw\\nhim kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.\\nHarry Potter come and live here!\"', '\"It\\'s the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and\\nuncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\\'s older. I\\'ve\\nwritten them a letter.\"', '\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on\\nthe wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a\\nletter? These people will never understand him! He\\'ll be famous -- a\\nlegend -- I wouldn\\'t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day\\nin the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child\\nin our world will know his name!\"', '\"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his\\nhalf-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy\\'s head. Famous\\nbefore he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\\'t even\\nremember! CarA you see how much better off he\\'ll be, growing up away\\nfrom all that until he\\'s ready to take it?\"', 'Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and\\nthen said, \"Yes -- yes, you\\'re right, of course. But how is the boy\\ngetting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she\\nthought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.', '\"Hagrid\\'s bringing him.\"', '\"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as\\nthis?\"', 'I would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore.', '\"I\\'m not saying his heart isn\\'t in the right place,\" said Professor\\nMcGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can\\'t pretend he\\'s not careless. He does\\ntend to -- what was that?\"', 'A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew\\nsteadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a\\nheadlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and\\na huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of\\nthem.', 'If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride\\nit. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times\\nas wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long\\ntangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands\\nthe size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were\\nlike baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle\\nof blankets.', '\"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did\\nyou get that motorcycle?\"', '\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit,\" said the giant, climbing\\ncarefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to\\nme. I\\'ve got him, sir.\"', '\"No problems, were there?\"', '\"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right\\nbefore the Muggles started swarmin\\' around. He fell asleep as we was\\nflyin\\' over Bristol.\"', 'Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of\\nblankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a\\ntuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously\\nshaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.', '\"Is that where -?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.', '\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He\\'ll have that scar forever.\"', '\"Couldn\\'t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"', '\"Even if I could, I wouldn\\'t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself\\nabove my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well\\n-- give him here, Hagrid -- we\\'d better get this over with.\"', \"Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.\", '\"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent his\\ngreat, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very\\nscratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a\\nwounded dog.', '\"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"you\\'ll wake the Muggles!\"', '\"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and\\nburying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can\\'t stand it -- Lily an\\' James dead\\n-- an\\' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -\"', '\"Yes, yes, it\\'s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or\\nwe\\'ll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly\\non the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to\\nthe front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out\\nof his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\\'s blankets, and then came back to\\nthe other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at\\nthe little bundle; Hagrid\\'s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall\\nblinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from\\nDumbledore\\'s eyes seemed to have gone out.', '\"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that\\'s that. We\\'ve no business staying\\nhere. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\"', '\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I\\'ll be takin\\' Sirius his\\nbike back. G\\'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.\"', 'Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself\\nonto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose\\ninto the air and off into the night.', '\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore,\\nnodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.', 'Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he\\nstopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and\\ntwelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet\\nDrive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking\\naround the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the\\nbundle of blankets on the step of number four.', '\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish\\nof his cloak, he was gone.', 'A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and\\ntidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect\\nastonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his\\nblankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside\\nhim and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was\\nfamous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\\' time by Mrs.\\nDursley\\'s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk\\nbottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and\\npinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn\\'t know that at this very\\nmoment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up\\ntheir glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy\\nwho lived!\"', '\\nCHAPTER TWO', 'THE VANISHING GLASS', \"Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find\\ntheir nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at\\nall. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass\\nnumber four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living\\nroom, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when\\nMr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the\\nphotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.\\nTen years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a\\nlarge pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley\\nDursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large\\nblond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a\\ncomputer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.\\nThe room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\", 'Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for\\nlong. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made\\nthe first noise of the day.', '\"Up! Get up! Now!\"', 'Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.', '\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then\\nthe sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his\\nback and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a\\ngood one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny\\nfeeling he\\'d had the same dream before.', 'His aunt was back outside the door.', '\"Are you up yet?\" she demanded.', '\"Nearly,\" said Harry.', '\"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\\'t you\\ndare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\\'s birthday.\"', 'Harry groaned.', '\"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door.', '\"Nothing, nothing...\"', \"Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out\\nof bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and,\\nafter pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to\\nspiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and\\nthat was where he slept.\", \"When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table\\nwas almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as\\nthough Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the\\nsecond television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a\\nracing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated\\nexercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's\\nfavorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry\\ndidn't look it, but he was very fast.\", \"Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry\\nhad always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and\\nskinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes\\nof Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry\\nhad a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He\\nwore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of\\nall the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry\\nliked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that\\nwas shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could\\nremember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt\\nPetunia was how he had gotten it.\", '\"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don\\'t ask\\nquestions.\"', \"Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the\\nDursleys.\", 'Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.', '\"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.', 'About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and\\nshouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts\\nthan the rest of the boys in his class put', 'together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way --\\nall over the place.', 'Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his\\nmother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face,\\nnot much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay\\nsmoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley\\nlooked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a\\npig in a wig.', \"Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult\\nas there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.\\nHis face fell.\", '\"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That\\'s two\\nless than last year.\"', '\"Darling, you haven\\'t counted Auntie Marge\\'s present, see, it\\'s here\\nunder this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\"', '\"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face.\\nHarry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down\\nhis bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.', 'Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,\\n\"And we\\'ll buy you another two presents while we\\'re out today. How\\'s\\nthat, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right\\'\\'', 'Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said\\nslowly, \"So I\\'ll have thirty ... thirty...\"', '\"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia.', '\"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right\\nthen.\"', 'Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money\\'s worth, just like\\nhis father. \\'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley\\'s hair.', 'At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it\\nwhile Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a\\nvideo camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and\\na VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia\\ncame back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.', '\"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg\\'s broken her leg. She can\\'t\\ntake him.\" She jerked her head in Harry\\'s direction.', \"Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every\\nyear on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the\\nday, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every\\nyear, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two\\nstreets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage\\nand Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever\\nowned.\", '\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\\'d\\nplanned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had\\nbroken her leg, but it wasn\\'t easy when he reminded himself it would be\\na whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and\\nTufty again.', '\"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested.', '\"Don\\'t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\"', \"The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't\\nthere -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't\\nunderstand them, like a slug.\", '\"What about what\\'s-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?\"', '\"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia.', '\"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he\\'d be able to\\nwatch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go\\non Dudley\\'s computer).', \"Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon.\", '\"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled.', '\"I won\\'t blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren\\'t listening.', '\"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \"...\\nand leave him in the car....\"', '\"That car\\'s new, he\\'s not sitting in it alone....\"', \"Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had\\nbeen years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up\\nhis face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\", '\"Dinky Duddydums, don\\'t cry, Mummy won\\'t let him spoil your special\\nday!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him.', '\"I... don\\'t... want... him... t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge,\\npretend sobs. \"He always sp- spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty\\ngrin through the gap in his mother\\'s arms.', 'Just then, the doorbell rang -- \"Oh, good Lord, they\\'re here!\" said Aunt\\nPetunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley\\'s best friend, Piers\\nPolkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face\\nlike a rat. He was usually the one who held people\\'s arms behind their\\nbacks while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.', \"Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in\\nthe back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the\\nzoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able\\nto think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle\\nVernon had taken Harry aside.\", '\"I\\'m warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up\\nclose to Harry\\'s, \"I\\'m warning you now, boy -- any funny business,\\nanything at all -- and you\\'ll be in that cupboard from now until\\nChristmas.\"', '\"I\\'m not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly..', \"But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did.\", \"The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was\\njust no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.\", 'Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking\\nas though he hadn\\'t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors\\nand cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which\\nshe left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly\\nat Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day,\\nwhere he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.\\nNext morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it\\nhad been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week\\nin his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he\\ncouldn\\'t explain how it had grown back so quickly.', \"Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting\\nold sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she\\ntried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until\\nfinally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit\\nHarry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to\\nhis great relief, Harry wasn't punished.\", \"On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on\\nthe roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as\\nusual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was\\nsitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter\\nfrom Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school\\nbuildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon\\nthrough the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash\\ncans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have\\ncaught him in mid- jump.\", \"But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with\\nDudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school,\\nhis cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.\", 'While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to\\ncomplain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the\\nbank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning,\\nit was motorcycles.', '\"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a\\nmotorcycle overtook them.', 'I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It\\nwas flying.\"', 'Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right\\naround in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet\\nwith a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON\\'T FLY!\"', 'Dudley and Piers sniggered.', 'I know they don\\'t,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\"', \"But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the\\nDursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking\\nabout anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a\\ndream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous\\nideas.\", \"It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The\\nDursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the\\nentrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry\\nwhat he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap\\nlemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they\\nwatched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley,\\nexcept that it wasn't blond.\", \"Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to\\nwalk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who\\nwere starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall\\nback on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo\\nrestaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker\\nglory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him\\nanother one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.\", 'Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to\\nlast.', \"After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in\\nthere, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts\\nof lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and\\nstone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick,\\nman-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the\\nplace. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car\\nand crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in\\nthe mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\", 'Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the\\nglistening brown coils.', '\"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the\\nglass, but the snake didn\\'t budge.', '\"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly\\nwith his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.', '\"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.', \"Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He\\nwouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no\\ncompany except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying\\nto disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a\\nbedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door\\nto wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\", \"The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised\\nits head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.\", 'It winked.', \"Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was\\nwatching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\", 'The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised\\nits eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:', '\"I get that all the time.', '\"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\'t sure the\\nsnake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\"', 'The snake nodded vigorously.', '\"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked.', 'The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry\\npeered at it.', 'Boa Constrictor, Brazil.', '\"Was it nice there?\"', 'The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:\\nThis specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see -- so you\\'ve never been to\\nBrazil?\"', 'As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of\\nthem jump.', '\"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON\\'T BELIEVE\\nWHAT IT\\'S DOING!\"', 'Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.', '\"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by\\nsurprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened\\nso fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were\\nleaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with\\nhowls of horror.', \"Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank\\nhad vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering\\nout onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and\\nstarted running for the exits.\", 'As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,\\nhissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.\"', 'The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.', '\"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\"', 'The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea\\nwhile he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only\\ngibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\\'t done anything except\\nsnap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were\\nall back in Uncle Vernon\\'s car, Dudley was telling them how it had\\nnearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to\\nsqueeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers\\ncalming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren\\'t you,\\nHarry?\"', 'Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before\\nstarting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to\\nsay, \"Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,\" before he collapsed into a\\nchair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.', \"Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He\\ndidn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were\\nasleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen\\nfor some food.\", \"He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as\\nlong as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents\\nhad died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when\\nhis parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long\\nhours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding\\nflash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he\\nsupposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green\\nlight came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and\\nuncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask\\nquestions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\", 'When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown\\nrelation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the\\nDursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped)\\nthat strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers\\nthey were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once\\nwhile out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry\\nfuriously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the\\nshop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in\\ngreen had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long\\npurple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and\\nthen walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these\\npeople was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a\\ncloser look.', \"At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated\\nthat odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and\\nnobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\", '\\nCHAPTER THREE', 'THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE', 'The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his\\nlongest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard\\nagain, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his\\nnew video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time\\nout on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet\\nDrive on her crutches.', \"Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang,\\nwho visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and\\nGordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and\\nstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite\\nhappy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\", \"This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\\nwandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he\\ncould see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off\\nto secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be\\nwith Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private\\nschool, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the\\nother hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley\\nthought this was very funny.\", '\"They stuff people\\'s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\"\\nhe told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\"', '\"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet\\'s never had anything as\\nhorrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before\\nDudley could work out what he\\'d said.', \"One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings\\nuniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn 't as bad as\\nusual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats,\\nand she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch\\ntelevision and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though\\nshe'd had it for several years.\", \"That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in\\nhis brand-new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange\\nknickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried\\nknobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't\\nlooking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\", \"As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said\\ngruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst\\ninto tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he\\nlooked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He\\nthought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to\\nlaugh.\", 'There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry\\nwent in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in\\nthe sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like\\ndirty rags swimming in gray water.', '\"What\\'s this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always\\ndid if he dared to ask a question.', '\"Your new school uniform,\" she said.', 'Harry looked in the bowl again.', '\"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn\\'t realize it had to be so wet.\"', '\"DotA be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I\\'m dyeing some of Dudley\\'s old\\nthings gray for you. It\\'ll look just like everyone else\\'s when I\\'ve\\nfinished.\"', 'Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue.

Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as\\nusual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere,\\non the table.\", 'They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the\\ndoormat.', '\"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.', '\"Make Harry get it.\"', '\"Get the mail, Harry.\"', '\"Make Dudley get it.\"', '\"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\"', \"Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things\\nlay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was\\nvacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a\\nbill, and -- a letter for Harry.\", \"Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant\\nelastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who\\nwould? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the\\nlibrary, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet\\nhere it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\", 'Mr. H.

His face went from red to green faster\\nthan a set of traffic lights. And it didn\\'t stop there. Within seconds\\nit was the grayish white of old porridge.', '\"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped.', 'Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it\\nhigh out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first\\nline. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her\\nthroat and made a choking noise.', '\"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!\"', \"They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and\\nDudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He\\ngave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\", '\"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. want to read it,\" said\\nHarry furiously, \"as it\\'s mine.\"', '\"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back\\ninside its envelope.', \"Harry didn't move.\", 'I WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted.', '\"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley.', '\"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the\\nscruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the\\nkitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but\\nsilent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry,\\nhis glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at\\nthe crack between door and floor.', '\"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the\\naddress -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps?

It only took Harry one trip\\nupstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He\\nsat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was\\nbroken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working\\ntank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the\\ncorner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot\\nthrough when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large\\nbirdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school\\nfor a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent\\nbecause Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They\\nwere the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been\\ntouched.\", 'From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don\\'t\\nwant him in there... I need that room... make him get out....\"', \"Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given\\nanything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with\\nthat letter than up here without it.\", \"Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in\\nshock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been\\nsick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the\\ngreenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was\\nthinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the\\nletter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each\\nother darkly.\", 'When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice\\nto Harry, made Dudley go and get it.

Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --\\'\"', \"With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the\\nhall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the\\nground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact\\nthat Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a\\nminute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the\\nSmelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with\\nHarry's letter clutched in his hand.\", '\"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry.\\n\"Dudley -- go -- just go.\"', \"Harry walked round and round his new room.

He\\nshouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make\\na cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the\\ntime he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.\\nHarry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\", 'I want --\" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into\\npieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He\\nstayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.', '\"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if\\nthey can\\'t deliver them they\\'ll just give up.\"', '\"I\\'m not sure that\\'ll work, Vernon.\"', '\"Oh, these people\\'s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\\'re not\\nlike you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the\\npiece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.', \"On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they\\ncouldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door,\\nslotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small\\nwindow in the downstairs bathroom.\", 'Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got\\nout a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and\\nback doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\"\\nas he worked, and jumped at small noises.', 'On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to\\nHarry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each\\nof the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt\\nPetunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious\\ntelephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone\\nto complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.', '\"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\" Dudley asked Harry in\\namazement.', 'On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking\\ntired and rather ill, but happy.', '\"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade\\non his newspapers, \"no damn letters today --\"', 'Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught\\nhim sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty\\nletters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys\\nducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.', '\"Out! OUT!\"', 'Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.\\nWhen Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their\\nfaces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters\\nstill streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.', '\"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling\\ngreat tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back\\nhere in five minutes ready to leave. We\\'re going away. Just pack some\\nclothes. No arguments!\"', 'He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared\\nargue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the\\nboarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway.\\nDudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the\\nhead for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and\\ncomputer in his sports bag.', 'They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\\'t dare ask where they\\nwere going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and\\ndrive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake\\'em off... shake \\'em\\noff,\" he would mutter whenever he did this.', \"They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was\\nhowling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd\\nmissed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone\\nso long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\", 'Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the\\noutskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds\\nand damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on\\nthe windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and\\nwondering....', 'They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for\\nbreakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the\\nhotel came over to their table.', '\"\\'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter?

The woman stared.', '\"I\\'ll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following\\nher from the dining room.', 'Wouldn\\'t it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested\\ntimidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\\'t seem to hear her. Exactly\\nwhat he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the\\nmiddle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in\\nthe car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle\\nof a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of\\na multilevel parking garage.', '\"Daddy\\'s gone mad, hasn\\'t he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that\\nafternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside\\nthe car, and disappeared.', 'It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley\\nsniveled.', '\"It\\'s Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto\\'s on tonight. I\\nwant to stay somewhere with a television. \"', \"Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you\\ncould usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of\\ntelevision -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of\\ncourse, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys\\nhad given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.\\nStill, you weren't eleven every day.\", \"Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long,\\nthin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd\\nbought.\", '\"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\"', 'It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what\\nlooked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was\\nthe most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was\\ncertain, there was no television in there.', '\"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his\\nhands together. \"And this gentleman\\'s kindly agreed to lend us his\\nboat!\"', 'A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather\\nwicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below\\nthem.', '\"I\\'ve already got us some rations,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"so all aboard!\"', 'It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their\\nnecks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like\\nhours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding,\\nled the way to the broken-down house.', 'The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind\\nwhistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was\\ndamp and empty. There were only two rooms.', \"Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four\\nbananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked\\nand shriveled up.\", '\"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\" he said cheerfully.', \"He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance\\nof reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately\\nagreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.\", 'As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the\\nhigh waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the\\nfilthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second\\nroom and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle\\nVernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find\\nthe softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest,\\nmost ragged blanket.', \"The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry\\ncouldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable,\\nhis stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the\\nlow rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of\\nDudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat\\nwrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and\\nwatched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would\\nremember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\", \"Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the\\nroof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did.\\nFour minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of\\nletters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow.\", 'Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like\\nthat? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was\\nthe rock crumbling into the sea?', \"One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten...\\nnine -- maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two...\\none...\", 'BOOM.', 'The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the\\ndoor. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.', '\\nCHAPTER FOUR', 'THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS', 'BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \"Where\\'s the cannon?\" he\\nsaid stupidly.', 'There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the\\nroom. He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been\\nin the long, thin package he had brought with them.', '\"Who\\'s there?\" he shouted. \"I warn you -- I\\'m armed!\"', 'There was a pause. Then --', 'SMASH!', 'The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and\\nwith a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.', 'A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost\\ncompletely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled\\nbeard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles\\nunder all the hair.', 'The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just\\nbrushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it\\neasily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a\\nlittle. He turned to look at them all.', '\"Couldn\\'t make us a cup o\\' tea, could yeh? It\\'s not been an easy\\njourney...\"', 'He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.', '\"Budge up, yeh great lump,\" said the stranger.', 'Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,\\nterrified, behind Uncle Vernon.', '\"An\\' here\\'s Harry!\" said the giant.', 'Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the\\nbeetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.', '\"Las\\' time I saw you, you was only a baby,\" said the giant. \"Yeh look a\\nlot like yet dad, but yeh\\'ve got yet mom\\'s eyes.\"', 'Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.', 'I demand that you leave at once, sit!\" he said. \"You are breaking and\\nentering!\"', '\"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over\\nthe back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\\'s hands, bent\\nit into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it\\ninto a corner of the room.', 'Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.', '\"Anyway -- Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \"a\\nvery happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on\\nit at some point, but it\\'ll taste all right.\"', 'From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly\\nsquashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a\\nlarge, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in\\ngreen icing.', 'Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words\\ngot lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \"Who are\\nyou?\"', 'The giant chuckled.', '\"True, I haven\\'t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and\\nGrounds at Hogwarts.\"', \"He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm.\", '\"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together.\\n\"I\\'d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh\\'ve got it, mind.\"', \"His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and\\nhe snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he\\nwas doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire\\nthere. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt\\nthe warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath.\", 'The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and\\nbegan taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a\\ncopper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several\\nchipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from\\nbefore starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and\\nsmell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was\\nworking, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt\\nsausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said\\nsharply, \"Don\\'t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\"', 'The giant chuckled darkly.', '\"Yet great puddin\\' of a son don\\' need fattenin\\' anymore, Dursley, don\\'\\nworry.\"', 'He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted\\nanything so wonderful, but he still couldn\\'t take his eyes off the\\ngiant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said,\\n\"I\\'m sorry, but I still don\\'t really know who you are.\"', 'The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his\\nhand.', '\"Call me Hagrid,\" he said, \"everyone does. An\\' like I told yeh, I\\'m\\nKeeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh\\'ll know all about Hogwarts, o\\' course.', '\"Er -- no,\" said Harry.', 'Hagrid looked shocked.', '\"Sorry,\" Harry said quickly.', '\"Sony?\" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back\\ninto the shadows. \"It\\' s them as should be sorry!

You\\'re famous.\"', '\"What? My -- my mom and dad weren\\'t famous, were they?\"', '\"Yeh don\\' know... yeh don\\' know...\" Hagrid ran his fingers through his\\nhair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.', '\"Yeh don\\' know what yeh are?\" he said finally.', 'Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.', '\"Stop!\" he commanded. \"Stop right there, sit!

He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as\\nthough he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out\\nof the window again.', '\"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as\\ninteresting as Ron found him.', '\"Er -- Yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom\\'s got a second cousin\\nwho\\'s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\"', '\"So you must know loads of magic already.\"', 'The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale\\nboy in Diagon Alley had talked about.', '\"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\"', '\"Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,\\nthough. Wish I\\'d had three wizard brothers.\"', '\"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I\\'m the sixth\\nin our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\\'ve got a lot to live up\\nto. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie\\nwas captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\\'s a prefect. Fred and George mess\\naround a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks\\nthey\\'re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others,\\nbut if I do, it\\'s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get\\nanything new, either, with five brothers. I\\'ve got Bill\\'s old robes,\\nCharlie\\'s old wand, and Percy\\'s old rat.\"', 'Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was\\nasleep.', '\"His name\\'s Scabbers and he\\'s useless, he hardly ever wakes up.

This seemed to cheer\\nRon up.\", '\"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn\\'t know anything about be ing a\\nwizard or about my parents or Voldemort\"', 'Ron gasped.', '\"What?\" said Harry.', '\"You said You-Know-Who\\'s name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and\\nimpressed. \"I\\'d have thought you, of all people --\"', '\"I\\'m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, I\\njust never knew you shouldn\\'t.

There\\'s loads of people who come from Muggle families and\\nthey learn quick enough.\"', 'While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.\\nNow they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were\\nquiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.', 'Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the\\ncorridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said,\\n\"Anything off the cart, dears?\"', \"Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears\\nwent pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went\\nout into the corridor.\", \"He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he\\nhad pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many\\nMars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars.

Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice\\nWands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his\\nlife.

I\\'m missing Agrippa.\"', '\"What?\"', '\"Oh, of course, you wouldn\\'t know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside\\nthem, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I\\'ve got about\\nfive hundred, but I haven\\'t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\"', \"Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a\\nman's face.

Perhaps they\\nthought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd\\nheard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\", '\"What has been going on?\" she said, looking at the sweets all over the\\nfloor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.', 'I think he\\'s been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry.

Harry and Ron were followed\\ninto their boat by Neville and Hermione. \"Everyone in?\" shouted Hagrid,\\nwho had a boat to himself. \"Right then -- FORWARD!\"', 'And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the\\nlake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at\\nthe great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer\\nand nearer to the cliff on which it stood.', '\"Heads down!\" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they\\nall bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain\\nof ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried\\nalong a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the\\ncastle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they\\nclambered out onto rocks and pebbles.', '\"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking the\\nboats as people climbed out of them.', '\"Trevor!\" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they\\nclambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\\'s lamp, coming out at\\nlast onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.', 'They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak\\nfront door.', '\"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?\"', 'Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle\\ndoor.', '\\nCHAPTER SEVEN', 'THE SORTING HAT', \"The door swung open at once.

So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just\\nstreamed through the back wall.

What they really needed was a\\nnice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.\", 'Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.\\nThey went off to lunch.', '\"You will keep looking while I\\'m away, won\\'t you?\" said Hermione. \"And\\nsend me an owl if you find anything.\"', '\"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron.\\n\"It\\'d be safe to ask them.\"', '\"Very safe, as they\\'re both dentists,\" said Hermione.', \"Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time\\nto think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the\\ncommon room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the\\ngood armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they\\ncould spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows\\n-- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk\\nabout even if they wouldn't work.\", \"Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like\\nMuggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot\\nlike directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered.\\nLike everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in\\nhis family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen\\nweren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble\\ngetting them to do what he wanted.\", 'Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn\\'t\\ntrust him at all. He wasn\\'t a very good player yet and they kept\\nshouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \"Don\\'t\\nsend me there, can\\'t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose\\nhim.\" On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next\\nday for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.\\nWhen he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a\\nsmall pile of packages at the foot of his bed.', '\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and\\npulled on his bathrobe.', '\"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I\\'ve got some presents!\"', '\"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which\\nwas a lot bigger than Harry\\'s.', 'Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and\\nscrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut\\nwooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it --\\nit sounded a bit like an owl.', 'A second, very small parcel contained a note.', 'We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle\\nVernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.', '\"That\\'s friendly,\" said Harry.', 'Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.', '\"Weird!\" he said, \\'NMat a shape! This is money?\"', '\"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid\\nand my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?\"', '\"I think I know who that one\\'s from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and\\npointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn\\'t expect\\nany presents and -- oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she\\'s made you a Weasley\\nsweater.\"', 'Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in\\nemerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.', '\"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own, \"and\\nmine\\'s always maroon.\"', '\"That\\'s really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was\\nvery tasty.', 'His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs\\nfrom Hermione.', 'This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very\\nlight. He unwrapped it.', 'Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it\\nlay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.', '\"I\\'ve heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of\\nEvery Flavor Beans he\\'d gotten from Hermione. \"If that\\'s what I think it\\nis -- they\\'re really rare, and really valuable.\"', '\"What is it?\"', 'Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to\\nthe touch, like water woven into material.', '\"It\\'s an invisibility cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \"I\\'m\\nsure it is -- try it on.\"', 'Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.', '\"It is! Look down!\"', 'Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the\\nmirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head\\nsuspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak\\nover his head and his reflection vanished completely.', '\"There\\'s a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of it!\"', 'Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow,\\nloopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your\\nfather left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was\\nreturned to you.

A hundred\\nfat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of\\nchipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy\\nand cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet\\nalong the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the\\nfeeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little\\nplastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard\\ncracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like\\na cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the\\ninside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at\\nthe High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a\\nflowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick\\nhad just read him.\", \"Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his\\nteeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid\\ngetting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine,\\nfinally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's\\namazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\", \"When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of\\nthings out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous\\nballoons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.\\nThe white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were\\ngoing to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.\", \"Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball\\nfight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they\\nreturned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in\\nhis new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he\\nwouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.\", \"After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,\\neveryone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and\\nwatch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because\\nthey'd stolen his prefect badge.\", \"It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever.

Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and\\nshadows. It was a very funny feeling.', 'Use it well.', 'Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him\\nin this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the\\ndark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch\\nwould never know.', \"Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back\\n-- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he\\nwanted to use it alone.\", 'He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,\\nand climbed through the portrait hole.', '\"Who\\'s there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked\\nquickly down the corridor.', \"Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then\\nit came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to\\nread as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.\\nHe set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he\\nwalked.\", 'The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his\\nway along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along\\nin midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the\\nsight gave him the creeps.', 'The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping\\ncarefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the\\nlibrary, he held up his lamp to read the titles.', \"They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled\\nwords in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all.\\nOne book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The\\nhairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it,\\nmaybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books,\\nas though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.\", 'He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,\\nhe looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large\\nblack and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with\\ndifficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee,\\nlet it fall open.', \"A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was\\nscreaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one\\nhigh, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over\\nhis lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming\\ndown the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the\\nshelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild\\neyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's\\noutstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks\\nstill ringing in his ears.\", \"He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been\\nso busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where\\nhe was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he\\nwas at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he\\nmust be five floors above there.\", '\"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was\\nwandering around at night, and somebody\\'s been in the library Restricted\\nSection.\"', 'Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must\\nknow a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and\\nto his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well,\\nthey can\\'t be far, we\\'ll catch them.\"', \"Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner\\nahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor\\nand if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak\\ndidn't stop him from being solid.\", 'He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It\\nwas his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying\\nnot to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room\\nwithout their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry\\nleaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps\\ndying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before\\nhe noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.', \"It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs\\nwere piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper\\nbasket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that\\ndidn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone\\nhad just put it there to keep it out of the way.\", 'It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold\\nframe, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved\\naround the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic\\nfading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved\\nnearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection\\nagain. He stepped in front of it.', 'He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He\\nwhirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the\\nbook had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but\\na whole crowd of people standing right behind him.', 'But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to\\nthe mirror.', \"There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,\\nreflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his\\nshoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible,\\ntoo? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's\\ntrick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?\", \"He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his\\nreflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt\\nthe air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their\\nreflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the\\nothers existed only in the mirror.\", \"She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her\\neyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the\\nglass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that\\nshe was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin,\\nblack-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore\\nglasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as\\nHarry's did.\", 'Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching\\nthat of his reflection.', '\"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\"', \"They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the\\nfaces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green\\neyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as\\nthough he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family,\\nfor the first time in his life.\", 'The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at\\nthem, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping\\nto fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache\\ninside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.', 'How long he stood there, he didn\\'t know. The reflections did not fade\\nand he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his\\nsenses. He couldn\\'t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He\\ntore his eyes away from his mother\\'s face, whispered, \"I\\'ll come back,\"\\nand hurried from the room.', '\"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly.', '\"You can come tonight, I\\'m going back, I want to show you the mirror.', '\"I\\'d like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly.', '\"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\\'ll be able to\\nshow me your other brothers and everyone.\"', '\"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my house\\nthis summer.

Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding?\\nWhat did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\", '\"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\"', \"What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror\\nroom again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much\\nmore slowly the next night.

I know it\\'s here somewhere.\"', 'They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction,\\nbut saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead\\nwith cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.', '\"It\\'s here -- just here -- yes!\"', 'They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his\\nshoulders and ran to the mirror.', 'There they were.

Hermione ignored him.', '\"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically, \"is the only known maker\\nof the Sorcerer\\'s Stone!\"', \"This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected.\", '\"The what?\" said Harry and Ron.', '\"Oh, honestly, don\\'t you two read? Look -- read that, there.\"', \"She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient\\nstudy of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a\\nlegendary substance with astonishing powers.

At times, he even wondered\\nwhether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions\\nlessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so\\nhorrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the\\nSorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had\\nthe horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.\", \"Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the\\nnext afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever\\nsee him alive again.

In the few seconds' silence, the dog\\ngrowled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell\\nback into its deep sleep.\", 'Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no\\nsign of the bottom.', 'He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his\\nfingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to\\nme, don\\'t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\\nDumbledore, right?\"', '\"Right,\" said Ron.', '\"See you in a minute, I hope...', 'And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,\\ndown and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on\\nsomething soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the\\ngloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.', '\"It\\'s okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp,\\nwhich was the open trapdoor, \"it\\'s a soft landing, you can jump!\"', 'Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.', '\"What\\'s this stuff?\" were his first words.', '\"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\\'s here to break the fall.\\nCome on, Hermione!\"', \"The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but\\nHermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side.\", '\"We must be miles under the school , she said.', '\"Lucky this plant thing\\'s here, really,\" said Ron.', '\"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both!\"', 'She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle\\nbecause the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist\\nsnakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs\\nhad already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.', 'Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\\nher. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant\\noff them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster\\nthe plant wound around them.', '\"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is -- it\\'s\\nDevil\\'s Snare!\"', '\"Oh, I\\'m so glad we know what it\\'s called, that\\'s a great help,\" snarled\\nRon, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his\\nneck. \"Shut up, I\\'m trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione.', '\"Well, hurry up, I can\\'t breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it\\ncurled around his chest.', '\"Devil\\'s Snare, Devil\\'s Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it\\nlikes the dark and the damp', '\"So light a fire!\" Harry choked.', '\"Yes -- of course -- but there\\'s no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her\\nhands.', '\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\"', '\"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,\\nmuttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had\\nused on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it\\nloosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.\\nWriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they\\nwere able to pull free.', '\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he\\njoined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.', '\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn\\'t lose his head in a crisis --\\n\\'there\\'s no wood,\\' honestly.\"', '\"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the\\nonly way forward.', \"All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of\\nwater trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and\\nHarry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart,\\nhe remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards'\\nbank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad\\nenough...\", '\"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered.', 'Harry listened.

On the\\nopposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.', '\"Do you think they\\'ll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron.', '\"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don\\'t look very vicious, but I suppose if\\nthey all swooped down at once... well, there\\'s no other choice... I\\'ll\\nrun.\"', 'He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted\\nacross the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at\\nhim any second, but nothing happened.

Winged keys --\\nlook carefully. So that must mean...\" he looked around the chamber while\\nthe other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes -- look!\\nBroomsticks! We\\'ve got to catch the key to the door!\"', '\"But there are hundreds of them!\"', 'Ron examined the lock on the door.', '\"We\\'re looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the\\nhandle.\"', 'They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into\\nthe midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the\\nbewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to\\ncatch one.', \"Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He\\nhad a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's\\nweaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large\\nsilver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and\\nstuffed roughly into the keyhole.\", '\"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one -- there -- no, there\\n-- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"', 'Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into\\nthe ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.', '\"We\\'ve got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the\\nkey with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione,\\nstay below and stop it from going down and I\\'ll try and catch it. Right,\\nNOW!\"', \"Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry\\nstreaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and\\nwith a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one\\nhand.

The moment\\nthe lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very\\nbattered now that it had been caught twice.', '\"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They\\nnodded. He pulled the door open.', \"The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as\\nthey stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an\\nastonishing sight.\", 'They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black\\nchessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what\\nlooked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the\\nwhite pieces.

Ron turned to the other two.', '\"This needs thinking about \\the said. I suppose we\\'ve got to take the\\nplace of three of the black pieces....\"', 'Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,\\n\"Now, don\\'t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at\\nchess --\"', '\"We\\'re not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\"', '\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90\\nnext to him instead of that castle.\"', '\"What about you?\"', '\"I\\'m going to be a knight,\" said Ron.', 'The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a\\nknight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces\\nand walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron,\\nand Hermione took.', '\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board.\\n\"Yes... look...\"', 'A white pawn had moved forward two squares.', \"Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he\\nsent them. Harry's knees were trembling.

Madam\\nPomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated\\nit.\"', '\"How long have I been in here?\"', '\"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved\\nyou have come round, they have been extremely worried.\"', '\"But sit, the Stone', 'I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor\\nQuirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to\\nprevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.', '\"You got there? You got Hermione\\'s owl?\"', '\"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it\\nbecame clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just\\nleft. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\"', '\"It was you.\"', '\"I feared I might be too late.\"', '\"You nearly were, I couldn\\'t have kept him off the Stone much longer --\"', '\"Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For\\none terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has\\nbeen destroyed.\"', '\"Destroyed?\" said Harry blankly. \"But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel --\"', '\"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.\\n\"You did do the thing properly, didn\\'t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had\\na little chat, and agreed it\\'s all for the best.\"', '\"But that means he and his wife will die, won\\'t they?\"', '\"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then,\\nyes, they will die.\"', \"Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face.\", '\"To one as young as you, I\\'m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas\\nand Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long\\nday. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great\\nadventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As\\nmuch money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings\\nwould choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of\\nchoosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\" Harry lay\\nthere, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the\\nceiling.', '\"Sir?\" said Harry. \"I\\'ve been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone\\'s\\ngone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --\"', '\"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear\\nof a name increases fear of the thing itself.\"', '\"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort\\'s going to try other ways of coming back,\\nisn\\'t he? I mean, he hasn\\'t gone, has he?\"', '\"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking\\nfor another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.\\nHe left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers\\nas his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his\\nreturn to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to\\nfight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed\\nagain, and again, why, he may never return to power.\"', 'Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then\\nhe said, \"Sir, there are some other things I\\'d like to know, if you can\\ntell me... things I want to know the truth about....\"', '\"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing,\\nand should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall\\nanswer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which\\ncase I beg you\\'ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\"', '\"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried\\nto stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the\\nfirst place?\"', 'Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.', '\"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not\\nnow. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry.\\nWhen you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are\\nready, you will know.\"', 'And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.', '\"But why couldn\\'t Quirrell touch me?\"', '\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot\\nunderstand, it is love. He didn\\'t realize that love as powerful as your\\nmother\\'s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to\\nhave been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone,\\nwill give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell,\\nfull of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort,\\ncould not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person\\nmarked by something so good.\"', 'Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,\\nwhich gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found\\nhis voice again, Harry said, \"And the invisibility cloak - do you know\\nwho sent it to me?\"', '\"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought\\nyou might like it.\" Dumbledore\\'s eyes twinkled. \"Useful things... your\\nfather used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food\\nwhen he was here.\"', '\"And there\\'s something else...\"', '\"Fire away.\"', '\"Quirrell said Snape --\"', '\"Professor Snape, Harry.\" \"Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because\\nhe hated my father. Is that true?\"', '\"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr.\\nMalfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\"', '\"What?\"', '\"He saved his life.\"', '\"What?\"', '\"Yes...\" said Dumbledore dreamily. \"Funny, the way people\\'s minds work,\\nisn\\'t it? Professor Snape couldn\\'t bear being in your father\\'s debt....\\nI do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt\\nthat would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to\\nhating your father\\'s memory in peace....\"', 'Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he\\nstopped.', '\"And sir, there\\'s one more thing...\"', '\"Just the one?\"', '\"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\"', '\"Ah, now, I\\'m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant\\nideas, and between you and me, that\\'s saying something. You see, only\\none who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be\\nable to get it, otherwise they\\'d just see themselves making gold or\\ndrinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now,\\nenough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie\\nBott\\'s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come\\nacross a vomitflavored one, and since then I\\'m afraid I\\'ve rather lost\\nmy liking for them -- but I think I\\'ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\\'t\\nyou?\"', 'He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he\\nchoked and said, \"Alas! Ear wax!\"', 'Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.', '\"Just five minutes,\" Harry pleaded.', '\"Absolutely not.\"', '\"You let Professor Dumbledore in...\"', '\"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need\\nrest.\"', '\"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam\\nPomfrey...\"', '\"Oh, very well,\" she said. \"But five minutes only.\"', 'And she let Ron and Hermione in.', '\"Harry!\"', 'Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was\\nglad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.', '\"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried\\n--\"', '\"The whole school\\'s talking about it,\" said Ron. \"What really happened?\"', \"It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more\\nstrange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything:\\nQuirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a\\nvery good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry\\ntold them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\", '\"So the Stone\\'s gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel\\'s just going to die?\"', '\"That\\'s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- \\'to\\nthe well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.', '\"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed\\nat how crazy his hero was.', '\"So what happened to you two?\" said Harry.', '\"Well, I got back all right,\" said Hermione. \"I brought Ron round --\\nthat took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact\\nDumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he\\njust said, \\'Harry\\'s gone after him, hasn\\'t he?\\' and hurtled off to the\\nthird floor.\"', '\"D\\'you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your\\nfather\\'s cloak and everything?\"', '\"Well, \" Hermione exploded, \"if he did -- I mean to say that\\'s terrible\\n-- you could have been killed.\"', '\"No, it isn\\'t,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He\\'s a funny man, Dumbledore.\\nI think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or\\nless everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty\\ngood idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just\\ntaught us enough to help. I don\\'t think it was an accident he let me\\nfind out how the mirror worked. It\\'s almost like he thought I had the\\nright to face Voldemort if I could....\"', '\"Yeah, Dumbledore\\'s off his rocker, all right,\" said Ron proudly.\\n\"Listen, you\\'ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The\\npoints are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last\\nQuidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but\\nthe food\\'ll be good.\"', 'At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.', '\"You\\'ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT\" she said firmly.', \"After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\", 'I want to go to the feast,\" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened\\nhis many candy boxes. I can, can\\'t I?\"', '\"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\" she said\\nstiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\\'t realize\\nhow risky feasts could be. \"And you have another visitor.\"', '\"Oh, good,\" said Harry. \"Who is it?\"', 'Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was\\nindoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry,\\ntook one look at him, and burst into tears.', '\"It\\'s -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!\" he sobbed, his face in his hands.\\nI told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only\\nthing he didn\\'t know, an\\' I told him! Yeh could\\'ve died! All fer a\\ndragon egg! I\\'ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an\\' made ter\\nlive as a Muggle!\"', '\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and\\nremorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \"Hagrid, he\\'d have\\nfound out somehow, this is Voldemort we\\'re talking about, he\\'d have\\nfound out even if you hadn\\'t told him.\"', '\"Yeh could\\'ve died!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"An\\' don\\' say the name!\"', '\"VOLDEMORT!\" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped\\ncrying. \"I\\'ve met him and I\\'m calling him by his name. Please cheer up,\\nHagrid, we saved the Stone, it\\'s gone, he can\\'t use it. Have a Chocolate\\nFrog, I\\'ve got loads....\"', 'Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \"That reminds\\nme. I\\'ve got yeh a present.\"', '\"It\\'s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\" said Harry anxiously, and at last\\nHagrid gave a weak chuckle. \"Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off\\nyesterday ter fix it. \\'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway,\\ngot yeh this...\"', 'It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it\\ncuriously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him\\nfrom every page were his mother and father.', '\"Sent owls off ter all yer parents\\' old school friends, askin\\' fer\\nphotos... knew yeh didn\\' have any... d\\'yeh like it?\"', \"Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.\", \"Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He\\nhad been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving\\nhim one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked\\nout in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's\\nwinning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner\\nshowing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\", 'When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started\\ntalking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione\\nat the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were\\nstanding up to look at him.', 'Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.', '\"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you\\nwith an old man\\'s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our\\ndelicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a\\nlittle fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get\\nthem nice and empty before next year starts....', '\"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the\\npoints stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and\\ntwelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two;\\nRavenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred\\nand seventy- two.\"', 'A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.\\nHarry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a\\nsickening sight.', '\"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent\\nevents must be taken into account.\"', \"The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.\", '\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out.\\nLet me see. Yes...', '\"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley...\"', 'Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.', '\"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I\\naward Gryffindor house fifty points.\"', 'Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars\\noverhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other\\nprefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past\\nMcGonagall\\'s giant chess set!\"', 'At last there was silence again.', '\"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the\\nface of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"', 'Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had\\nburst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside\\nthemselves -- they were a hundred points up. \"Third -- to Mr. Harry\\nPotter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve\\nand outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\"', 'The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves\\nhoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points\\n-- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if\\nonly Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.', 'Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.', '\"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a\\ngreat deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to\\nstand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville\\nLongbottom.\"', \"Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some\\nsort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted\\nfrom the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and\\ncheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people\\nhugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.\\nHarry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who\\ncouldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the\\nBody-Bind Curse put on him.\", '\"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even\\nRavenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we\\nneed a little change of decoration.\"', \"He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet\\nand the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a\\ntowering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor\\nMcGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye\\nand Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed\\none jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back\\nto normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.\", \"It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at\\nQuidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would\\nnever, ever forget tonight.\", \"Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but\\ncome they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good\\nmarks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even\\nNeville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his\\nabysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid\\nas he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a\\nshame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.\", 'And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,\\nNeville\\'s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were\\nhanded out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the\\nholidays (\"I always hope they\\'ll forget to give us these,\" said Fred\\nWeasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats\\nthat sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express;\\ntalking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier;\\neating Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns;\\npulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling\\ninto platform nine and three-quarters at King\\'s Cross Station.', \"It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened\\nold guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate\\nin twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out\\nof a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\", '\"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you -- I\\'ll\\nsend you an owl.\"', '\"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I\\'ll need something to look forward to.\" People\\njostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle\\nworld. Some of them called:', '\"Bye, Harry!\"', '\"See you, Potter!\"', '\"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him.', '\"Not where I\\'m going, I promise you,\" said Harry.', 'He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \"There he is,\\nMom, there he is, look!\"', \"It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at\\nRon.\", '\"Harry Potter!\" she squealed. \"Look, Mom! I can see', '\"Be quiet, Ginny, and it\\'s rude to point.\"', 'Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.', '\"Busy year?\" she said.', '\"Very,\" said Harry. \"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs.\\nWeasley.\"', '\"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\"', '\"Ready, are you?\"', 'It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking\\nfurious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station\\nfull of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley,\\nlooking terrified at the very sight of Harry.', '\"You must be Harry\\'s family!\" said Mrs. Weasley.', '\"In a manner of speaking,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"Hurry up, boy, we haven\\'t\\ngot all day.\" He walked away.', 'Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.', '\"See you over the summer, then.\"', '\"Hope you have -- er -- a good holiday,\" said Hermione, looking\\nuncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so\\nunpleasant.', '\"Oh, I will,\" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was\\nspreading over his face. \"They don\\'t know we\\'re not allowed to use magic\\nat home.
